# Filemanager
This project based on the MVC architecture.
This is a simple application that allows you to browse files 
in a directory, open them. It also quickly calculates the sizes of folders
and files in asynchronous mode and has two windows for working with files.

Filemanager uses JDBC for caching folder sizes, ViewPager for two Windows and RecyclerView for a list of folders and files.
